I've received my Ph.D. in KAIST, South Korea. My advisor was [Prof. Seungryong Cho](http://mirlab.kaist.ac.kr).  
  
I'm currently a Research Fellow in the Dept. of Radiation Oncology Massachusetts General Hospital.  
  
I'm interested in sparse CT image reconstruction, automating radiotherapy planning.
